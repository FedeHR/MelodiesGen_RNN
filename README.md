# MelodiesGen_RNN
An approach to melodies generation using the Recurrent Neural Network architecture. For now, most of the project is based on @musikalkemist tutorials on the subject.

For now, I'm working on the preprocessing, specifically working with .krn files. Later I'll add a preprocessing option for other common formats such as MIDI files. Then I'll start implementing the model and possibly extend it to other DL architectures.
